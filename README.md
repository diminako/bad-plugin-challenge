# bad-plugin-challenge

This project is a base for getting to learn how to create plugins for WordPress. 

Making good software is hard, so that's why we're going to make bad software. 

Here's some ideas for potential WordPress plugins. 

1. Jiggle the page to increase CLS with an element that's always outside of the viewport. 
2. Insert a loud (bonus points for abnoxiousness) video into the middle of the content you're trying to read. 
3. Extra font adder, add some fonts to the page load (just incase).
4. Mobile Last Contact Forms: How much of the small screen can you cover with a form? Add a close button that shrinks a little bit when you hover it. 
5. Jump to Whatever Button: Add a button that jumps to wherever on the page.
6. Add an element to the page that makes the whole thing scroll sideways, just a little bit. Bonus points if it only does it only does it at night (PST Timezone). 
7. Broken Link Maker: find all the links to a specific domain and break em.

To contribute, fork this project, and start as simple as you'd like, or consider using a plugin template like this one: https://github.com/devinvinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate/
