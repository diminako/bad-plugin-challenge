# bad-plugin-challenge

This project is a base for getting to learn how to create plugins for WordPress. 

Making good software is hard, so that's why we're going to make bad software. 

Here's some ideas for potential WordPress plugins. 

1. Jiggle the page to increase CLS that's difficult to find. 
2. Insert a loud (bonus points for abnoxiousness) video into the middle of the content reading. 
3. Extra font adder, add some fonts to the page load (just incase)
4. Mobile Last Contact Forms: How much of the small screen can you cover with a form. 
5. Jump to Whatever: Add a button that jumps to wherever on the page.
6. Add an element to the page that makes the whole thing scroll sideways (bonus points if it only does it only does it at night).
